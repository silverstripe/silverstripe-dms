## Overview

The module adds a new `DMSDocument` model which allows management of large amounts of files, and their relations to
pages. In contrast to the `File` model built into SilverStripe core, it aims to wrap storage and access concerns in
a generic API. This allows more fine-grained control over how the documents are managed and exposed through the website.

Additionally, documents are stored and managed as part of a page instead of away in a separate assets store.

## Features

 * Relation of documents to pages
 * Relation of documents to other documents
 * Management and upload of documents within a page context in the CMS
 * Metadata management through the powerful `GridField` and `UploadField` core APIs
 * Download via SilverStripe controller (rather than filesystem URLs)
 * Access control based on PHP logic, and page relations
 * Replacement of existing files
 * Tagging via the [taxonomy module](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-taxonomy) if installed
